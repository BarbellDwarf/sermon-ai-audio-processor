UI Job Queue Integration Test using MCP Playwright tools

This test verifies that:
1. Batch processing creates jobs that persist when navigating away
2. New sermon processing creates jobs that persist when navigating away  
3. Jobs can be monitored from the Jobs page
4. Jobs run in the background independently of the UI
